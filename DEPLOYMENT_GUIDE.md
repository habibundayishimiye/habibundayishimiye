# 🚀 GitHub Profile README - Deployment Guide

## Quick Steps to Deploy Your Awesome Profile

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub - New Repository](https://github.com/new)
2. **Repository name:** `habibundayishimiye` (MUST match your username exactly)
3. **Visibility:** Public
4. **Do NOT** check "Initialize with README" (you already have one)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your README to GitHub

Open your terminal and run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd "c:/Programmer Hab Jass/Full Stack Developer/GitHub/habibundayishimiye"

# Stage your README file
git add README.md

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "🎉 Add professional GitHub profile README"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/habibundayishimiye/habibundayishimiye.git

# Push to GitHub (main branch)
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** If you get an error about the branch name, try:
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Your Profile

Visit your GitHub profile:
